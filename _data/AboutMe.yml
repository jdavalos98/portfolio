  - description: "Hi there! I’m a full-stack software developer with a strong background in leadership, communication, and collaboration. Before transitioning into tech, I held leadership roles in retail and restaurant management, where I honed my skills in time management, teamwork, and problem-solving. These experiences have shaped me into a developer who thrives in dynamic environments, values clear communication, and strives to lead teams toward success. My passion for technology and gaming led me to software development, where I’m excited to build user-friendly, engaging applications for gamers and content creators. I’m particularly interested in creating tools that enhance the gaming experience and offer content creators more control over their work. I bring a unique perspective to my development work, combining creativity with technical expertise, and I’m eager to continue learning, growing, and experimenting with new technologies. As I move forward in my career, I’m focused on building applications that empower users, streamline workflows, and create enjoyable experiences. I’m looking for a company that values creativity, collaboration, and innovation, where I can continue to grow as a developer and contribute to impactful projects. Outside of work, I’m still passionate about gaming, often taking on the role of Dungeon Master in Dungeons & Dragons campaigns, where I can apply my strategic thinking and creativity. I’m excited to continue my journey in tech, solving problems, and creating meaningful applications that improve the lives of gamers and content creators alike."
